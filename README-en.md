`Nongli` is a Chinese traditional calendar, depending on predicted positions of the Sun and the Moon. 

> In Chinese, `nong` means agriculture and `li` means calendar. 

[Purple Mountain Observatory, CAS](http://english.pmo.cas.cn/) is responsible for calculations and promulgations of `nongli` according to Chinese standard [GB/T 33661-2017](https://std.samr.gov.cn/gb/search/gbDetailed?id=71F772D817FDD3A7E05397BE0A0AB82A). As a lunisolar calendar, `nongli` not only reflects seasonality and phenology, but also indicates the moon phase and the tide, and thus is widely used in daily life and production, like agriculture, fishery, flood prevention, sailing, etc.
